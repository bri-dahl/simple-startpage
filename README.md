# simple-startpage
I got tired of trying different Chrome New Tab extensions and having every one either missing features that I need, or having features that I don't, so I made my own startpage to serve as my new tab background. This was my first project using HTML and CSS.  

I followed instructions provided at https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Browser-Startpage/ and further customised the page to best suit me. As I have learned more about HTML and CSS, I have also refactored the code to be cleaner and more easily maintained or changed.
